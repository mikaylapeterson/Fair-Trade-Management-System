# Fairtrade Certification Management System

A desktop/mobile application that is aimed to help streamline the Fairtrade application process for small scale producers who wish to become Fairtrade certified.

## UN SDGs

- SDG 1 - No Poverty
- SDG 12 - Responsible Production & Consumption

## Background/Business Opportunity

Fairtrade is an international standard that is used to regulate the growth of key individual ingredients in particular products as well as the regulation of the product itself in several areas including trade and production of the actual product. The application process to become a Fairtrade ingredient producer can be daunting and it can be difficult to keep track of what documents and information that you need to provide to the certification body, as well as when you need to supply up to date copies of these documents. The certification has to be continually renewed and the certificate holder can be audited at any time.

The complexity of the application process is partially due to the sheer length of the standards documents (40+ pages) and the language used in them. Fairtrade doesnâ€™t appear to offer any assistance with helping producers organize and keep track of these documents. Documents required for this certification are simply emailed to the appropriate licensing body and then the licensing body follows their own internal application scheme. 

Since it is critical to keep track of these documents and it can be difficult to navigate the standards document, there is an opportunity to make an application that helps the producers keep create and keep track of these documents as well as specific dates related to the certification process.
