## Background/Business Opportunity

Fairtrade is an international standard that is used to regulate the growth of key individual ingredients in particular products as well as the regulation of the product itself in several areas including trade and production of the actual product. The application process to become a Fairtrade ingredient producer can be daunting and it can be difficult to keep track of what documents and information that you need to provide to the certification body, as well as when you need to supply up to date copies of these documents. The certification has to be continually renewed and the certificate holder can be audited at any time.

The complexity of the application process is partially due to the sheer length of the standards documents (40+ pages) and the language used in them. Fairtrade doesnâ€™t appear to offer any assistance with helping producers organize and keep track of these documents. Documents required for this certification are simply emailed to the appropriate licensing body and then the licensing body follows their own internal application scheme. 

Since it is critical to keep track of these documents and it can be difficult to navigate the standards document, there is an opportunity to make an application that helps the producers keep create and keep track of these documents as well as specific dates related to the certification process. 

## Installation and Use
!! This project has only been confirmed to work on the iOS device simulator on macOS Sonoma. The macOS version itself is **not stable** and I do not guarantee that it works !!

### Prerequisites
To get up and running, all you need to download from this GitHub is the Flutter subfolder located in the Application directory.

Once you are in the Flutter directory, you are going to want to install Flutter according to the instructions listed [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) for your operating system!

### Usage
1. Open the simulator app that comes with XCode and open a device running iOS17
2. Open Visual Studio Code
3. Install the [Flutter Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.flutter) and the [Dart Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.dart-code)
4. Open the Flutter folder in Visual Studio Code
5. It should prompt you to run 'pub get' to update all the dependencies
6. Click Run without debugging
7. Select the Dart & Flutter debugger in the drop down
8. Wait for it to connect to the simulator (it can take a while)
9. It runs!

I also have a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/YyuhDWdNC6E) demonstrating this and I show the extensions needed at the end as well. You might need to fast forward through it
